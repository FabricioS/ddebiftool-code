bugs/unexpected behaviour:

* p_topsol: branching off from Hopf with negative omega should use 
  period=2*pi/abs(omega) (this is done), and conj(v) for the vector

* correct_ini: calls sys_cond without checking extra_condition

* p_stabil for fixed points: when eigenvalue is numerical Inf, it gets
  removed (when delay is zero)

annoying:

* br_contn online plot always plots on current axis: fix axes and give
  user option to set it
