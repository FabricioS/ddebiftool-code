Contents of this package
------------------------

* Continuation and stability routines for periodic solutions of NDDEs
* Continuation routines for equilibria of NDDEs
* Stability routines for NDDEs with a single fixed delay

This package requires DDE-BIFTOOL. To use this package, simply add these files
to your Matlab path AHEAD of the corresponding DDE-BIFTOOL files.

Once installed, this files will allow you to work with NDDEs of the form
            x'(t) = f(x(t),x(t-tau),x'(t-tau),lambda)
in the same manner as DDE-BIFTOOL works for DDEs.

When generating system definition files (i.e. sys_rhs.m and sys_deri.m), the
state vector is provided as follows

xx = [x(t) x(t-tau1) x(t-tau2) x(t-tau_n) x'(t-tau1) x'(t-tau2) x'(t-tau_n)]

e.g. if there are two delays then xx(:,3) is x(t-tau2) and xx(:,4) is x'(t-tau1)

In sys_deri.m you are required to provide derivatives with respect to the
delayed derivatives as well as the delayed variables themselves.

Alternatively, you can use the Maple(TM) worksheet (sysdef.mw) to automatically
generate the necessary files.

*** You must create a file sys_ndde.m that simply returns 1 ***

For example

function result = sys_ndde()
result = 1;

This tells NDDE-CONT that we are dealing with an NDDE rather than a DDE.
