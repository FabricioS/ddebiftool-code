To install:

* unzipping ddebif.zip creates a "ddebiftool" directory (named "ddebiftool") 
  containing all DDE-BIFTOOL files (Matlab format). 
* unzipping system.zip creates a "system" directory
  should create three subdirectories named demo, sd_demo, hom_demo
* replace the path within each routine sys_init.m (part of each demo)
  by the path of the "ddebiftool" directory
* run Matlab (version 5.3 or higher) in the "system/demo" directory
* call demo1 from within Matlab
* if the output does not match the one described in the manual, 
  mail the contact person

Please feel free to mail any feedback concerning the code
(such as the type of application; the problems you encountered; 
or aspects that you would like to see improved). 
Preprints or papers containing results obtained with the package 
are also very welcome.
