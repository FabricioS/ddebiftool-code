{\DDEBIFCODE\ v.~2.00} is a collection of Matlab routines for numerical 
bifurcation
analysis of systems of delay differential equations with several constant
and state-dependent delays. The package allows to compute, 
continue and analyse stability of
steady state solutions and periodic solutions. 
It further allows to compute and
continue steady state fold and Hopf bifurcations and
to switch, from the latter, to an emanating branch of periodic
solutions.  Homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits can also be computed.
To analyse the stability of steady state solutions, 
approximations are computed to
the rightmost, stability-determining roots of the characteristic
equation which can sub\-sequently be used as starting values in a Newton
procedure.
For periodic solutions, approximations to the Floquet multipliers
are computed.
We describe the structure of the package, its routines,
and its data and method parameter structures.
We illustrate its use through a step-by-step analysis of several
demo systems.
